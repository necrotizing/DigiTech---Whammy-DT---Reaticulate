# Whammy-DT---Reaticulate
This is my first experience with anything regarding coding so if anything is done wrong then let me know and I'll dive into getting it right. 
  //I think everything is fine though, this is very basic stuff and works really well with my Digitech Whammy DT.
    //Just need to remember to have the ReaControlMIDI plugin first in the chain before Reaticulate.
